Your docker-compose.yml looks mostly good, but there are a few things to be aware of and potentially improve. I'll walk through the configuration and highlight any changes or suggestions.

Breakdown of the Services:
1. nginx service
Your nginx service is configured correctly,
 but ensure you have the correct nginx.dockerfile in the context directory for building the nginx image.



   nginx:
     build:
       context: .
       dockerfile: nginx.dockerfile
     container_name: nginx
     networks:
       - laravel
     ports:
       - "8080:80"
       - "443:443"
     volumes:
       - ./src:/var/www/html
This will map the src folder to /var/www/html inside the container, which is typically
where the application code resides.


2. php service
You're setting up the PHP service to run Laravel. The user and environment settings are
 passed correctly, ensuring that the container runs as the same user as the host
 (typically for proper file permissions).

  php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: php.dockerfile
    container_name: php
    networks:
      - laravel
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - WWWUSER=${UID:-1000}  # Pass host UID to container
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"  # Run container as host user

This ensures your PHP container runs as the same user, helping avoid file permission
issues when Laravel tries to write to directories like storage and bootstrap/cache.

3. mysql service
The MySQL service is properly configured, but keep in mind that you should
ensure docker-compose waits for MySQL to be fully ready before running any artisan
commands (like migrations).


  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_DATABASE: dockerdb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
    networks:
      - laravel
    ports:
      - "4306:3306"
    volumes:
      - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost", "-uuser", "-psecret" ]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 10

The healthcheck is a great addition to ensure MySQL is up and ready to accept connections
before other services (like artisan) try to connect.


4. composer service
The composer service is configured to run Composer commands. It mounts the project source code into the container and sets the working
directory to /var/www/html.

  composer:
    image: composer:latest
    container_name: composer
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www/html
    working_dir: /var/www/html
    entrypoint: [ "composer" ]
    networks:
      - laravel

This allows you to run Composer commands inside the container. For example,
you can run docker-compose run --rm composer install to i
nstall dependencies.


5. artisan service
This is the key part where you're able to run Artisan commands directly through Docker.
By using the entrypoint, you're able to pass commands to php artisan.

  artisan:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: php.dockerfile
    container_name: artisan
    volumes:
      - ./src:/var/www/html
    working_dir: /var/www/html
    entrypoint: [ "php", "artisan" ]
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - laravel
    environment:
      DB_HOST: mysql
      DB_PORT: 3306
      DB_DATABASE: dockerdb
      DB_USERNAME: user
      DB_PASSWORD: secret


The entrypoint is set to run php artisan by default.

The depends_on with condition: service_healthy ensures that mysql must be fully ready (via the health check)
before the artisan container starts.

This configuration allows you to run commands like docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate
or docker-compose run --rm artisan db:seed.
